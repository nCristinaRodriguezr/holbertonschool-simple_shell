.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsimple_shell\fR command is a custom command-line interface designed to execute commands and operate within a basic shell environment. The shell provides users with an interactive way to interact with the operating system, allowing for the execution of programs and system commands. The "simple_shell" implements a set of essential shell functionalities, including command execution, path handling, input processing, and string manipulation.

Upon startup, \fBsimple_shell\fR displays a command prompt for entering commands. It reads user inputs, processes them, and executes the corresponding commands. The shell also handles the search and execution of programs located in system paths or relative paths.

The code of the "simple_shell" is organized into several functions. The \fBexecute_func()\fR function handles reading and executing commands, while \fBstrtrim()\fR removes whitespace around user inputs. The \fBtokenizeInput()\fR function divides input strings into separate arguments, and \fBget_full_path()\fR constructs full paths for entered commands.

This shell is presented as a lightweight option to interact with the system and run basic commands. However, please note that this implementation is a basic version and may lack some advanced features present in more comprehensive shells.

.SH INVOCATION

     When invoked without options or arguments, and if the standard input is connected to a terminal (or with the -i flag), \fBhsh\fR operates as an interactive
     shell. It prompts before each command and handles errors differently. If argument 0 begins with a dash ‘-’, \fBhsh\fR is considered a login shell. It reads
     commands from /etc/profile and .profile (if they exist) and, if set, from the file specified in the ENV environment variable. Users can customize login-time
     and interactive shell commands in the .profile and ENV files.

     When command line arguments are provided, the first argument becomes the name of a file for reading commands (shell script), and the rest are set as positional
     parameters ($1, $2, etc). Otherwise, \fBhsh\fR reads commands from standard input.
